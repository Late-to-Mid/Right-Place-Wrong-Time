# Right-Place-Wrong-Time

## TO-DO
1. Get a weapon and projectile system working.
	The Code is there, stolen shamelessly from Unity's FPS game. I need to go through it all, take out what I don't want, and make sure I understand it all.2. Go through PlayerCharacterController
	I don't fully understand everything that's going on here. I want to continue reading the code, refactoring to help myself. Perhaps there's a few changes I could make (on top of things I've already done) to improve it.
